      - project:
        title: "Secure and Scalable RF Ranging Systems"
        time: 2016 - Present
        advisor: "Advisor: Prof. Srdjan Capkun, ETH Zurich"
        tagline: "The attacks on the ranging and positioning systems have real-world impact. The existing ranging systems are shown vulnerable to physical and link layer attacks. This project is a step toward designing the secure ranging systems, where two or more entities can obtain their correct distance measurement in the presence of an adversary. "
      - project:
        title: "SenseX: Wellness as a service"
        time: 2014 - 2016
        tagline: "With the increasing number of desk jobs, workplaces have become the epicenter of several health risks. SenseX uses a variety of devices and sensors to track the physical activity level of employees in an organization. SenseX platform offers APIs which can be used by 3rd party applications to create services and applications, which can focus on specific interventions."
      - project:
        title: CityZen
        time: 2014 - 2016
        tagline: "Modern citizens are actively discussing and expressing opinions about city-related issues in open public forums on the web. This project acts as an effective conduit between the residents and the civic agencies, by collecting timely information from different online sources and providing actionable insights to the agencies on pressing city issues."
      - project:
        title: High density enterprise wireless LANs
        time: 2013 - 2014
        advisor: "Advisor: Prof. Sanjit Krishnan Kaul, IIIT Delhi"
        tagline: "While the density of access points in enterprise settings has increased, the sharing of the spatial resource amongst links in 802.11 wireless local area networks remains inefficient. We formulate an optimization problem to maximize network throughput by careful sharing of space (transmit data simultaneously). The throughput is maximized by piggybacking data on the transmission opportunities seized by another link."

        title: Trishulam
        advisor: "Advisor: Prof. Pushpendra Singh, IIIT Delhi" 
        time: 2012 - 2013
        tagline: "An initiative for women safety - an application on the Android platform allowing preselection of safety modes and notifying the contacts of the primary user about a panic condition. It delivered feature-rich data about primary user’s smartphone to emergency contacts. Various sensors such as GPS, microphone, and camera run by services on primary user smartphone and emergency contacts, can access this information in real time."
